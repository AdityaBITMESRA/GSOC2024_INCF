# GSoC2024_INCF
Repository for the details of my work in the Google Summer Of Code 2024 with the INCF organisation 

This readme file will contain details about my work that I have done throughout my GSoC period with the INCF organisation.
I have also blogged about my journey and challenges in my personal blog here 
[Aditya's Blog](https://adityabitmesra.github.io/personalblog/)

My goal was to make a Python Based SWC to NeuroML Converter.
With the instruction of my mentors I divided my task into two parts which was trying to make a Python program to Load the 
SWC format and then a second one to do the conversion.

The converter was tested against many SWC files from [Neuromorpho.org](https://neuromorpho.org/) and some major cells from [Allen 
Institute database](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/AllenInstituteNeuroML/tree/master/CellTypesDatabase/models)
